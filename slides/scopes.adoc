= JSF managed beans and scopes

== Using Java objects in JSF facelets

 - objects are referenced using string names
 - objects are created (managed) by JSF
 - an object is defined by a class and a string name
 - an object has a scope
 ** within a scope always a single instance
 ** in 2 different scopes 2 different instances
 
== Types of managed beans

[width="100%",options="header,footer", cols="1,1,1,4,1"]
|=====================================================
| Type | Annotation | Java packages | Description | Usage
| JSF managed bean | `@ManagedBean` | `javax.faces.bean` | JSF-specific managed beans, cannot be used outside JSF lifecycle | _deprecated_
| CDI bean | `@Named` | `javax.inject`, `javax.enterprise.context`, `javax.faces.view` | Common Java EE beans for injection (CDI = Contexts & Dependency Injection). Can be used everywhere in a Java EE application. JSF only requires `@Named` annotation to give it a name | **recommended** 
| EJB | `@Stateless`, ... | `javax.ejb` | Enterprise Java Beans - transactional managed beans. Can be used everywhere in a Java EE application. JSF only requires `@Named` annotation to give it a name | **recommended** if CDI beans not sufficient 
| Implicit bean | N/A |  N/A | Provided by JSF automatically, using https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/jsp/el/ImplicitObjectELResolver.html[ImplicitObjectELResolver]. Mostly maps with request-related attributes. Cannot be used outside JSF/JSP lifecycle. | in JSF pages

== Scopes in JSF

[width="100%",options="header,footer", cols="1,4,1,1"]
|====================
| Scope name | Description | CDI annotation | JSF annotation 
| Application | A single instance for whole application. Similar to singleton. | javax.enterprise.context. **ApplicationScoped** | javax.faces.bean. ApplicationScoped
| Session | A single instance for a HTTP session | javax.enterprise.context. **SessionScoped** | javax.faces.bean. SessionScoped
| Request | A single instance for a HTTP request | 
javax.enterprise.context. **RequestScoped** | javax.faces.bean. RequestScoped
| View |  A single instance for a HTML/JSF page, including AJAX requests |
javax.faces.view. **ViewScoped** | javax.faces.bean. ViewScoped
| No scope | A new instance is created for each parent | 
javax.enterprise.context. **Dependent** | javax.faces.bean. NoneScoped

== CDI-based managed bean

`Controller.java`:
```
@Named
@RequestScoped
public class Controller {
   public String getGreeting() {
       return "Hello, world!";
   } 
}
```

`index.xhtml`:
```
#{controller.greeting}
```

== Injecting CDI bean into Java code

`Action.java`:
```
@Named
@RequestScoped
public class
