= Implementing multi-language translations

== Using standard JSF locale and resource bundles configured in faces-config.xml

* JSF can automatically guess the most appropriate language for the user based on locales in the browser
* Texts are translated using resource bundles referred to using their variable name
* Translations are stored with the application inside property files and no easy way to customize this

== Using custom resource bundles

* A bean that extends ResourceBundle with `@Named` annotation can be used for translations without breaking existing code
* This custom resource bundle can provide translations in a flexible way (read translations from DB, etc.)
