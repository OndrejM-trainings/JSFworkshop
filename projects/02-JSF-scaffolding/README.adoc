= Scaffolding tools

There are several automated scaffolding options, but none of them is robust enough to recommend for productive usage.

 - Netbeans Java IDE can generate JSF/Primefaces CRUD pages from JPA entities
 - JBoss Forge command line tool can also generate CRUD pages from JPA entities (https://forge.jboss.org/), see http://forge.jboss.org/document/hands-on-lab[Forge Hands-on-Lab]

The best option is to write the code by hand or write a custom generatator.

JBoss Forge generated code can work as an inspiration.
