= Support for right-to-left languages

Right-to-left rendering can be turned on on multiple levels:

 - HTML5 `dir` attribute set to `ltr` or `rtl`
 - Many Primefaces components also provide `dir` attribute
 - Default direction in Primefaces can be set with `primefaces.DIR` context parameter, which supports expressions to set the value dynamically
 - Components that don't provide the `dir` attibute need to be styled separately with CSS
