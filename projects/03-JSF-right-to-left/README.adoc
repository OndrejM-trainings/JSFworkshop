= Support for right-to-left languages

Right-to-left rendering can be turned on on multiple levels:

 - HTML5 `dir` attribute set to `ltr` or `rtl` changes direction of components in the browser
 ** the value of this attribute cascades so it's enough to set it on a top-level element
 - Many Primefaces components also provide `dir` attribute
 - Default direction in Primefaces can be set with `primefaces.DIR` context parameter in `web.xml`
 ** the value can be an EL expression to set the value dynamically
 - Components that don't provide the `dir` attibute need to be styled separately with CSS
 ** it's a good practice to mark a top-level element with a special class if RTL is in place
