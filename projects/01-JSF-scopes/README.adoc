= Practice using beans and scopes in JSF

This application shows how to access CDI beans in JSF pages and in Java code.

Exercises:

- experiment with scopes: change scopes of beans used in contextsController and observe how it changes the behavior in scopes.xhtml
- create a new named CDI bean and use it with a selector component. Change scopes of the bean and see for how long a value is preserved
- add a change listener to the selector component to display selected value in another component, e.g. outputPanel. Which scope is most convenient?
- create a new page and display the selected value from the previous page on that page. Which scope is most convenient? How can we reduce the required scope?
